        The skin in the box was a deep, rich scarlet, and as Althea gazed upon it, she was struck by how lifelike it looked. The shade of red seemed to shift and shimmer in the ambient light, casting a captivating, almost hypnotic glow.

        The horns on the headpiece were short and sharp, and the long, tapered tail snaked around the legs of the suit in a sinuous curve. The material shimmered in the light, appearing as if it were almost alive.

              ...and the horns on the headpiece were not just for show - they were made of a slightly firmer, yet still flexible material. As she ran her fingers over them, she could feel the intricate ridges and curves, giving them a tactile and realistic feel.

        Althea traced the curve of her breasts, feeling the material compress and release with each breath. The sensation was incredible, and she couldn't help but moan softly as she traced the curve of her cleavage. Her fingers then traveled down to her waist, feeling the tightness of the corset-like design that cinched her in and highlighted her curves.

        As she reached the groin area, Althea hesitated for a moment. She wondered how the artificial vagina would feel and what kind of pleasure it would bring her. After a moment of hesitation, she couldn't resist any longer and carefully pushed the sheath into her body, feeling it slide in smoothly.
